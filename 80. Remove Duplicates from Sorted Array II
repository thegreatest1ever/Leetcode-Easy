/*
However, there is a potential issue with the implementation. 
The code tries to check nums[i+2] within the loop, but it could cause an "out of bounds" error when i approaches the end of the array.
To fix this issue, you could modify the loop condition to i < nums.length - 2, which ensures that there are at least two more elements ahead to compare.
